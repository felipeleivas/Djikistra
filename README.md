# Djikistra
Still in progress, but after i finish will receive a graph, in DIMACS format(http://www.diag.uniroma1.it/challenge9/download.shtml), and will calculate a distance between two nodes, it uses a minHeap as it's priority queue


caso_teste:
generates a graph and applies a djkistra algorithm to calculate a distance between two nodes, the graph will be saved as a file("graph.main"), for the code runs, you will need download and install boost library(https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.63.0/), the programm receives the number of nodes and edges as arguments
